# Loreal Datathon 2025 Noog Goobers: GooberAI

## Problem Statement 1: TrendSpotter
Trends reflect what’s currently captivating our community. For L'Oréal, identifying and
leveraging them early is crucial for staying relevant, boosting engagement, and driving
innovation in beauty.

## Deliverables:
1. A functional prototype of an AI-powered solution for trend identification. This prototype
should demonstrate the ability to analyze audio snippets, hashtags, and keywords to
identify emerging trends.
2. Demonstration showcasing the capabilities and benefits of the AI-enhanced trend
identification system, potentially including how it identifies key segments participating
in a trend (e.g., Gen Z, Millennials) and how it might indicate when a trend starts to
decay.
3. Recorded presentation
